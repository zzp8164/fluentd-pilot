[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/AliyunContainerService/fluentd-pilot.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/AliyunContainerService/fluentd-pilot)

`fluentd-pilot` is an awesome docker log tool. With `fluentd-pilot` you can collect logs from docker hosts and send them to your centralize log system such as elasticsearch, graylog2, awsog and etc. `fluentd-pilot` can collect not only docker stdout but also log file that inside docker containers.

Try it
======

Prerequisites:

- docker-compose >= 1.6
- Docker Engine >= 1.10

```
git clone git@github.com:AliyunContainerService/fluentd-pilot.git
cd fluentd-pilot/quickstart
./run
```

Then access kibana under the tips. You will find that tomcat's has been collected and sended to kibana.

Create index:
![kibana](quickstart/Kibana.png)

Query the logs:
![kibana](quickstart/Kibana2.png)

Quickstart
==========

### Run pilot

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /:/host \
    registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs-sample/fluentd-pilot:latest
```

### Run applications whose logs need to be collected

Open a new terminal, run the application. With tomcat for example:

```
docker run -it --rm  -p 10080:8080 \
    -v /usr/local/tomcat/logs \
    --label aliyun.logs.catalina=stdout \
    --label aliyun.logs.access=/usr/local/tomcat/logs/localhost_access_log.*.txt \
    tomcat
```

Now watch the output of fluentd-pilot. You will find that fluentd-pilot get all tomcat's startup logs. If you access tomcat with your broswer, access logs in `/usr/local/tomcat/logs/localhost_access_log.\*.txt` will also be displayed in fluentd-pilot's output.

Feature
========

- Single fluentd process per docker host. You don't need to create new fluentd process for every docker container.
- Support both stdout and file. Either Docker log driver or logspout can only collect stdout.
- Declarative configuration. You need do nothing but declare the logs you want to collect.
- Support many log management: elastichsearch, graylog2, awslogs and more.
- Tags. You could add tags on the logs collected, and later filter by tags in log management.
